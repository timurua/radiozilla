This release is expected to become the final 3.13.0 release, barring any critical bugs being discovered. The official release of 3.13.0 is now scheduled for Monday, 2024-10-07.This extra, unplanned release candidate exists because of a couple of last minute issues, primarily a significant performance regression in specific workloads due to the incremental cyclic garbage collector (introduced in the alpha releases). We decided to roll back the garbage collector change in 3.13 (and continuing work in 3.14 to improve it), apply a number of other important bug fixes, and roll out a new release candidate.There will be no ABI changes from this point forward in the 3.13 series (and there haven't been any since the beta releases).Call to actionWe strongly encourage maintainers of Python projects to prepare their projects for 3.13 compatibilities during this phase, and where necessary publish Python 3.13 wheels on PyPI to be ready for the final release of 3.13.0.

However,\\n due to an incompatibility with older macOS versions, macOS 10.9 through\\n 10.12 will downgrade their version of pip to 24.1.2 during the \\ninstallation process (in the Install Certificates step). See the installer ReadMe and the pip issue on the matter\\n for more information. Versions of macOS older than 10.13 haven’t been \\nsupported by Apple since 2019, and maintaining support for them is \\nbecoming increasingly difficult.

More exceptions potentially caused by typos now make suggestions to the user.Support for the Linux perf profiler to report Python function names in traces.Many large and small performance improvements (like PEP 709 and support for the BOLT binary optimizer), delivering an estimated 5% overall performance improvement.\\nType annotations\\nNew type annotation syntax for generic classes (PEP 695).New override decorator for methods (PEP 698).\\nDeprecations\\nThe deprecated wstr and wstr_length members of the C implementation of unicode objects were removed, per PEP 623.In the unittest module, a number of long deprecated methods and classes were removed. (They had been deprecated since Python 3.1 or 3.2).The deprecated smtpd and distutils modules have been removed (see PEP 594 and PEP 632. The setuptools package continues to provide the distutils module.A number of other old, broken and deprecated functions, classes and methods have been removed.Invalid backslash escape sequences in strings now warn with SyntaxWarning instead of DeprecationWarning, making them more visible. (They will become syntax errors in the future.)The internal representation of integers has changed in preparation \\nfor performance enhancements.

More exceptions potentially caused by typos now make suggestions to the user.Support for the Linux perf profiler to report Python function names in traces.Many large and small performance improvements (like PEP 709 and support for the BOLT binary optimizer), delivering an estimated 5% overall performance improvement.\\nType annotations\\nNew type annotation syntax for generic classes (PEP 695).New override decorator for methods (PEP 698).\\nDeprecations\\nThe deprecated wstr and wstr_length members of the C implementation of unicode objects were removed, per PEP 623.In the unittest module, a number of long deprecated methods and classes were removed. (They had been deprecated since Python 3.1 or 3.2).The deprecated smtpd and distutils modules have been removed (see PEP 594 and PEP 632. The setuptools package continues to provide the distutils module.A number of other old, broken and deprecated functions, classes and methods have been removed.Invalid backslash escape sequences in strings now warn with SyntaxWarning instead of DeprecationWarning, making them more visible. (They will become syntax errors in the future.)The internal representation of integers has changed in preparation \\nfor performance enhancements.

The free-threaded \\nbuild is not installed by default; use the Customize option of the \\ninstaller as explained in the installer readme.

It is a concentration of heat, light or radiation so intense that its energy forms an event horizon and becomes self-trapped. In other words, if enough radiation is aimed into a region of space, the concentration of energy can warp spacetime so much that it creates a black hole. This would be a black hole whose original mass–energy was in the form of radiant energy rather than matter, however as soon as it forms, it is indistinguishable from an ordinary black hole.We hope you enjoy the new releases!Thanks to all of the many volunteers who help make Python Development and these releases possible!

Further, because it has five quarks instead of the usual three found in regular baryons (a.k.a. 'triquarks'), it is classified as an exotic baryon. The name pentaquark was coined by Claude Gignoux and Harry J. Lipkin in 1987; however, the possibility of five-quark particles was identified as early as 1964 when Murray Gell-Mann first postulated the existence of quarks. Although predicted for decades, pentaquarks proved surprisingly difficult to discover and some physicists were beginning to suspect that an unknown law of nature prevented their production.We hope you enjoy the new releases!Thanks to all of the many volunteers who help make Python Development and these releases possible!

(This should not affect most users as it \\nis an internal detail, but it may cause problems for Cython-generated \\ncode.)\\nFor more details on the changes to Python 3.12, see What’s new in Python 3.12.\\n\\xa0More resources\\nOnline Documentation.PEP 693, the Python 3.12 Release Schedule.Report bugs via GitHub Issues.Help fund Python and its community.\\n\\xa0And now for something completely different\\nThey have no need of our help\\nSo do not tell me\\nThese haggard faces could belong to you or me\\nShould life have dealt a different hand\\nWe need to see them for who they really are\\nChancers and scroungers\\nLayabouts and loungers\\nWith bombs up their sleeves\\nCut-throats and thieves\\nThey are not\\nWelcome here\\nWe should make them\\nGo back to where they came from\\nThey cannot\\nShare our food\\nShare our homes\\nShare our countries\\nInstead let us\\nBuild a wall to keep them out\\nIt is not okay to say\\nThese are people just like us\\nA place should only belong to those who are born there\\nDo not be so stupid to think that\\nThe world can be looked at another way\\n\\n(now read from bottom to top)\\n\\nRefugees, by Brian Bilston.\\xa0We hope you enjoy the new releases!\\nThanks to all of the many volunteers who help make Python Development\\n and these releases possible!

These include new features like exception groups, fine-grained error locations in tracebacks, and support for parsing TOML files.\\n\\n **Python 3.12.0** marks a major update with several key additions:\\n\\n* **Enhanced F-strings:** Greater flexibility in parsing allows for previously unsupported constructs.\\n* **Buffer Protocol Support:** Enables Python code to interact directly with memory buffers.\\n* **New Debugging/Profiling API:** Facilitates more efficient code analysis and optimization.\\n* **Isolated Subinterpreters:**  Allows for parallel execution with separate Global Interpreter Locks.\\n\\nPython 3.12 also introduces new type annotation syntax, an \"override\" decorator for methods, and numerous performance enhancements. Some deprecated features have been removed.\\n\\n\\nThe announcement concludes by acknowledging the volunteers who contribute to Python development and encouraging support for the Python Software Foundation.  It ends with a thought-provoking poem titled \"Refugees\" by Brian Bilston, prompting reflection on societal attitudes towards those seeking refuge.', directory='/media/timur/TESLA SSD/2024-11-14T13.48.17.794021_run')]"

It is possible to construct malicious pickle data which will execute arbitrary code during unpickling (See https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/SECURITY.md#untrusted-models for more details). In a future release, the default value for `weights_only` will be flipped to `True`. This limits the functions that could be executed during unpickling. Arbitrary objects will no longer be allowed to be loaded via this mode unless they are explicitly allowlisted by the user via `torch.serialization.add_safe_globals`. We recommend you start setting `weights_only=True` for any use case where you don't have full control of the loaded file.
