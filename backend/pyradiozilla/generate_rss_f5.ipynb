(Compared to the last release candidate, 3.13.0rc3, 3.13.0 contains two small bug fixes and some documentation and testing changes.)Major new features of the 3.13 series, compared to 3.12Some of the new major new features and changes in Python 3.13 are:New featuresA\\xa0new and improved interactive interpreter, based on\\xa0PyPy’s, featuring multi-line editing and color support, as well as colorized\\xa0exception tracebacks.An\\xa0experimental\\xa0free-threaded build mode, which disables the Global Interpreter Lock, allowing threads to run more concurrently. The build mode is available as an experimental feature in the Windows and macOS installers as well.A\\xa0preliminary,\\xa0experimental\\xa0JIT, providing the ground work for significant performance improvements.The\\xa0locals()\\xa0builtin function (and its C equivalent) now has\\xa0well-defined semantics when mutating the returned mapping, which allows debuggers to operate more consistently.A modified version of\\xa0mimalloc\\xa0is now included, optional but enabled by default if supported by the platform, and required for the free-threaded build mode.Docstrings now have\\xa0their leading indentation stripped, reducing memory use and the size of .pyc files. (Most tools handling docstrings already strip leading indentation.)The\\xa0dbm module\\xa0has a new\\xa0dbm.sqlite3 backend\\xa0that is used by default when creating new files.The minimum supported macOS version was changed from 10.9 to\\xa010.13 (High Sierra). Older macOS versions will not be supported going forward.WASI is now a\\xa0Tier 2 supported platform. Emscripten is no longer an\\xa0officially supported platform\\xa0(but\\xa0Pyodide\\xa0continues to support Emscripten).iOS is now a\\xa0Tier 3 supported platform.Android is now a\\xa0Tier 3 supported platform.TypingSupport for\\xa0type defaults in type parameters.A\\xa0new type narrowing annotation,\\xa0typing.TypeIs.A new annotation for\\xa0read-only items in TypeDicts.A new annotation for\\xa0marking deprecations in the type system.Removals and new deprecationsPEP 594 (Removing dead batteries from the standard library)\\xa0scheduled removals of many deprecated modules:\\xa0aifc,\\xa0audioop,\\xa0chunk,\\xa0cgi,\\xa0cgitb,\\xa0crypt,\\xa0imghdr,\\xa0mailcap,\\xa0msilib,\\xa0nis,\\xa0nntplib,\\xa0ossaudiodev,\\xa0pipes,\\xa0sndhdr,\\xa0spwd,\\xa0sunau,\\xa0telnetlib,\\xa0uu,\\xa0xdrlib,\\xa0lib2to3.Many other removals\\xa0of deprecated classes, functions and methods in various standard library modules.C API\\xa0removals\\xa0and\\xa0deprecations.

This release is expected to become the final 3.13.0 release, barring any critical bugs being discovered. The official release of 3.13.0 is now scheduled for Monday, 2024-10-07.This extra, unplanned release candidate exists because of a couple of last minute issues, primarily a significant performance regression in specific workloads due to the incremental cyclic garbage collector (introduced in the alpha releases). We decided to roll back the garbage collector change in 3.13 (and continuing work in 3.14 to improve it), apply a number of other important bug fixes, and roll out a new release candidate.There will be no ABI changes from this point forward in the 3.13 series (and there haven't been any since the beta releases).Call to actionWe strongly encourage maintainers of Python projects to prepare their projects for 3.13 compatibilities during this phase, and where necessary publish Python 3.13 wheels on PyPI to be ready for the final release of 3.13.0.

Well:\\nIn the interactive interpreter, exception tracebacks are now colorized by default.A preliminary, experimental JIT was added, providing the ground work for significant performance improvements.The (cyclic) garbage collector is now incremental, which should mean shorter pauses for collection in programs with a lot of objects.Docstrings now have their leading indentation stripped, reducing memory use and the size of .pyc files. (Most tools handling docstrings already strip leading indentation.)The dbm module has a new dbm.sqlite3 backend that is used by default when creating new files.PEP 594 (Removing dead batteries from the standard library) scheduled removals of many deprecated modules: aifc, audioop, chunk, cgi, cgitb, crypt, imghdr, mailcap, msilib, nis, nntplib, ossaudiodev, pipes, sndhdr, spwd, sunau, telnetlib, uu, xdrlib, lib2to3.Many other removals of deprecated classes, functions and methods in various standard library modules.New deprecations, most of which are scheduled for removal from Python 3.15 or 3.16.C API removals and deprecations.

It is a concentration of heat, light or radiation so intense that its energy forms an event horizon and becomes self-trapped. In other words, if enough radiation is aimed into a region of space, the concentration of energy can warp spacetime so much that it creates a black hole. This would be a black hole whose original mass–energy was in the form of radiant energy rather than matter, however as soon as it forms, it is indistinguishable from an ordinary black hole.We hope you enjoy the new releases!Thanks to all of the many volunteers who help make Python Development and these releases possible!

Thanks to Sebastian Pipping, the maintainer of libexpat, who \\nworked with us directly on incorporating those fixes!gh-109858: zipfile is now protected from the “quoted-overlap” zipbomb to address CVE-2024-0450. It now raises BadZipFile when attempting to read an entry that overlaps with another entry or central directorygh-91133: tempfile.TemporaryDirectory cleanup no longer dereferences symlinks when working around file system permission errors to address CVE-2023-6597gh-115197: urllib.request no longer resolves the hostname before checking it against the system’s proxy bypass list on macOS and Windowsgh-81194: a crash in socket.if_indextoname() with a specific value (UINT_MAX) was fixed.

We have the Security Developer in Residence @sethmlarson to thank for that!\\nIt’s a big deal since public builds allow for easier auditing and \\nrepeatability.

This is in fact the case\\n with two of the CVEs listed above (CVE-2023-6597 and CVE-2024-0450).

Further, because it has five quarks instead of the usual three found in regular baryons (a.k.a. 'triquarks'), it is classified as an exotic baryon. The name pentaquark was coined by Claude Gignoux and Harry J. Lipkin in 1987; however, the possibility of five-quark particles was identified as early as 1964 when Murray Gell-Mann first postulated the existence of quarks. Although predicted for decades, pentaquarks proved surprisingly difficult to discover and some physicists were beginning to suspect that an unknown law of nature prevented their production.We hope you enjoy the new releases!Thanks to all of the many volunteers who help make Python Development and these releases possible!
