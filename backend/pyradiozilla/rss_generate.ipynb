It is possible to construct malicious pickle data which will execute arbitrary code during unpickling (See https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/SECURITY.md#untrusted-models for more details). In a future release, the default value for `weights_only` will be flipped to `True`. This limits the functions that could be executed during unpickling. Arbitrary objects will no longer be allowed to be loaded via this mode unless they are explicitly allowlisted by the user via `torch.serialization.add_safe_globals`.

      "Python 3.13.0 (final) released: Python 3.13.0 is now availablehttps://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3130/This is the stable release of Python 3.13.0Python 3.13.0 is the newest major release of the Python programming language, and it contains many new features and optimizations compared to Python 3.12. (Compared to the last release candidate, 3.13.0rc3, 3.13.0 contains two small bug fixes and some documentation and testing changes.)Major new features of the 3.13 series, compared to 3.12Some of the new major new features and changes in Python 3.13 are:New featuresA new and improved interactive interpreter, based on PyPy’s, featuring multi-line editing and color support, as well as colorized exception tracebacks.An experimental free-threaded build mode, which disables the Global Interpreter Lock, allowing threads to run more concurrently. The build mode is available as an experimental feature in the Windows and macOS installers as well.A preliminary, experimental JIT, providing the ground work for significant performance improvements.The locals() builtin function (and its C equivalent) now has well-defined semantics when mutating the returned mapping, which allows debuggers to operate more consistently.A modified version of mimalloc is now included, optional but enabled by default if supported by the platform, and required for the free-threaded build mode.Docstrings now have their leading indentation stripped, reducing memory use and the size of .pyc files. (Most tools handling docstrings already strip leading indentation.)The dbm module has a new dbm.sqlite3 backend that is used by default when creating new files.The minimum supported macOS version was changed from 10.9 to 10.13 (High Sierra). Older macOS versions will not be supported going forward.WASI is now a Tier 2 supported platform. Emscripten is no longer an officially supported platform (but Pyodide continues to support Emscripten).iOS is now a Tier 3 supported platform.Android is now a Tier 3 supported platform.TypingSupport for type defaults in type parameters.A new type narrowing annotation, typing.TypeIs.A new annotation for read-only items in TypeDicts.A new annotation for marking deprecations in the type system.Removals and new deprecationsPEP 594 (Removing dead batteries from the standard library) scheduled removals of many deprecated modules: aifc, audioop, chunk, cgi, cgitb, crypt, imghdr, mailcap, msilib, nis, nntplib, ossaudiodev, pipes, sndhdr, spwd, sunau, telnetlib, uu, xdrlib, lib2to3.Many other removals of deprecated classes, functions and methods in various standard library modules.C API removals and deprecations. (Some removals present in alpha 1 were reverted in alpha 2, as the removals were deemed too disruptive at this time.)New deprecations, most of which are scheduled for removal from Python 3.15 or 3.16.For more details on the changes to Python 3.13, see What’s new in Python 3.13.More resourcesOnline DocumentationPEP 719, 3.13 Release ScheduleReport bugs via GitHub Issues.Help fund Python directly (or via GitHub Sponsors), and support the Python community.We hope you enjoy the new releases!Thanks to all of the many volunteers who help make Python Development and these releases possible!

More exceptions potentially caused by typos now make suggestions to the user.Support for the Linux perf profiler to report Python function names in traces.Many large and small performance improvements (like PEP 709 and support for the BOLT binary optimizer), delivering an estimated 5% overall performance improvement.Type annotationsNew type annotation syntax for generic classes (PEP 695).New override decorator for methods (PEP 698).DeprecationsThe deprecated wstr and wstr_length members of the C implementation of unicode objects were removed, per PEP 623.In the unittest module, a number of long deprecated methods and classes were removed. (They had been deprecated since Python 3.1 or 3.2).The deprecated smtpd and distutils modules have been removed (see PEP 594 and PEP 632. The setuptools package continues to provide the distutils module.A number of other old, broken and deprecated functions, classes and methods have been removed.Invalid backslash escape sequences in strings now warn with SyntaxWarning instead of DeprecationWarning, making them more visible. (They will become syntax errors in the future.)The internal representation of integers has changed in preparation for performance enhancements. (This should not affect most users as it is an internal detail, but it may cause problems for Cython-generated code.)For more details on the changes to Python 3.12, see What’s new in Python 3.12. More resourcesOnline Documentation.PEP 693, the Python 3.12 Release Schedule.Report bugs via GitHub Issues.Help fund Python directly or via GitHub Sponsors, and support the Python community. Enjoy the new releasesThanks to all of the many volunteers who help make Python Development and these releases possible!

      "Python 3.13.0 release candidate 3 released: I'm pleased to announce the release of Python 3.13 release candidate 3 (instead of the expected final release).https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3130rc3/ This is the final release candidate of Python 3.13.0This release, 3.13.0rc3, is the final release preview (no really) of 3.13. This release is expected to become the final 3.13.0 release, barring any critical bugs being discovered. The official release of 3.13.0 is now scheduled for Monday, 2024-10-07.This extra, unplanned release candidate exists because of a couple of last minute issues, primarily a significant performance regression in specific workloads due to the incremental cyclic garbage collector (introduced in the alpha releases). We decided to roll back the garbage collector change in 3.13 (and continuing work in 3.14 to improve it), apply a number of other important bug fixes, and roll out a new release candidate.There will be no ABI changes from this point forward in the 3.13 series (and there haven't been any since the beta releases).Call to actionWe strongly encourage maintainers of Python projects to prepare their projects for 3.13 compatibilities during this phase, and where necessary publish Python 3.13 wheels on PyPI to be ready for the final release of 3.13.0. Any binary wheels built against Python 3.13.0rc1 and later will work with future versions of Python 3.13. As always, report any issues to the Python bug tracker.Please keep in mind that this is a preview release and while it’s as close to the final release as we can get it, its use is not recommended for production environments.Core developers: time to work on documentation nowAre all your changes properly documented?Are they mentioned in What’s New?Did you notice other changes you know of to have insufficient documentation? Major new features of the 3.13 series, compared to 3.12Some of the new major new features and changes in Python 3.13 are:New featuresA new and improved interactive interpreter, based on PyPy’s, featuring multi-line editing and color support, as well as colorized exception tracebacks.An experimental free-threaded build mode, which disables the Global Interpreter Lock, allowing threads to run more concurrently. The build mode is available as an experimental feature in the Windows and macOS installers as well.A preliminary, experimental JIT, providing the ground work for significant performance improvements.The locals() builtin function (and its C equivalent) now has well-defined semantics when mutating the returned mapping, which allows debuggers to operate more consistently.A modified version of mimalloc is now included, optional but enabled by default if supported by the platform, and required for the free-threaded build mode.Docstrings now have their leading indentation stripped, reducing memory use and the size of .pyc files. (Most tools handling docstrings already strip leading indentation.)The dbm module has a new dbm.sqlite3 backend that is used by default when creating new files.The minimum supported macOS version was changed from 10.9 to 10.13 (High Sierra). Older macOS versions will not be supported going forward.WASI is now a Tier 2 supported platform. Emscripten is no longer an officially supported platform (but Pyodide continues to support Emscripten).iOS is now a Tier 3 supported platformAndroid is now a Tier 3 supported platform as well.TypingSupport for type defaults in type parameters.A new type narrowing annotation, typing.TypeIs.A new annotation for read-only items in TypeDicts.A new annotation for marking deprecations in the type system.Removals and new deprecationsPEP 594 (Removing dead batteries from the standard library) scheduled removals of many deprecated modules: aifc, audioop, chunk, cgi, cgitb, crypt, imghdr, mailcap, msilib, nis, nntplib, ossaudiodev, pipes, sndhdr, spwd, sunau, telnetlib, uu, xdrlib, lib2to3.Many other removals of deprecated classes, functions and methods in various standard library modules.C API removals and deprecations. (Some removals present in alpha 1 were reverted in alpha 2, as the removals were deemed too disruptive at this time.)New deprecations, most of which are scheduled for removal from Python 3.15 or 3.16.(Hey, fellow core developer, if a feature you find important is missing from this list, let Thomas know.)For more details on the changes to Python 3.13, see What’s new in Python 3.13.

      "A new and improved interactive interpreter , based on PyPy’s, featuring multi-line editing and color support, as well as colorized exception tracebacks .An experimental free-threaded build mode , which disables the Global Interpreter Lock, allowing threads to run more concurrently. The build mode is available as an experimental feature in the Windows and macOS installers as well.A preliminary, experimental JIT , providing the ground work for significant performance improvements.The (cyclic) garbage collector is now incremental , which should mean shorter pauses for collection in programs with a lot of objects.A modified version of mimalloc  is now included, optional but enabled by default if supported by the platform, and required for the free-threaded build mode.Docstrings now have their leading indentation stripped, reducing memory use and the size of .pyc files. (Most tools handling docstrings already strip leading indentation.)The dbm module  has a new dbm.sqlite3 backend  that is used by default when creating new files.The minimum supported macOS version was changed from 10.9 to 10.13 (High Sierra). Older macOS versions will not be supported going forward. \n",
      "Typing\n",
      "Support for type defaults in type parameters.A new type narrowing annotation , typing.TypeIs.A new annotation for read-only items in TypeDicts .\n",
      "Removals and new deprecations\n",

(Most tools handling docstrings already strip leading indentation.)The dbm module has a new dbm.sqlite3 backend that is used by default when creating new files.PEP 594 (Removing dead batteries from the standard library) scheduled removals of many deprecated modules: aifc, audioop, chunk, cgi, cgitb, crypt, imghdr, mailcap, msilib, nis, nntplib, ossaudiodev, pipes, sndhdr, spwd, sunau, telnetlib, uu, xdrlib, lib2to3.Many other removals of deprecated classes, functions and methods in various standard library modules.New deprecations, most of which are scheduled for removal from Python 3.15 or 3.16.C API removals and deprecations.

Python 3.11 is up to 10-60% faster than Python 3.10. On average, we measured a 1.22x speedup on the standard benchmark suite. See Faster CPython for details.More resourcesOnline DocumentationPEP 664, 3.11 Release ScheduleReport bugs at https://bugs.python.org.Help fund Python and its community.And now for something completely differentA kugelblitz is a theoretical astrophysical object predicted by general relativity. It is a concentration of heat, light or radiation so intense that its energy forms an event horizon and becomes self-trapped. In other words, if enough radiation is aimed into a region of space, the concentration of energy can warp spacetime so much that it creates a black hole. This would be a black hole whose original mass–energy was in the form of radiant energy rather than matter, however as soon as it forms, it is indistinguishable from an ordinary black hole.We hope you enjoy the new releases!Thanks to all of the many volunteers who help make Python Development and these releases possible!

Further, because it has five quarks instead of the usual three found in regular baryons (a.k.a. 'triquarks'), it is classified as an exotic baryon. The name pentaquark was coined by Claude Gignoux and Harry J. Lipkin in 1987; however, the possibility of five-quark particles was identified as early as 1964 when Murray Gell-Mann first postulated the existence of quarks. Although predicted for decades, pentaquarks proved surprisingly difficult to discover and some physicists were beginning to suspect that an unknown law of nature prevented their production.We hope you enjoy the new releases!Thanks to all of the many volunteers who help make Python Development and these releases possible!

      " Major new features of the 3.13 series, compared to 3.12 Python 3.13 is still in development. This release, 3.13.0a2 is the second of seven planned alpha releases.Alpha releases are intended to make it easier to test the current state of new features and bug fixes and to test the release process.During the alpha phase, features may be added up until the start of the beta phase (2024-05-07) and, if necessary, may be modified or deleted up until the release candidate phase (2024-07-30). Please keep in mind that this is a preview release and its use is not recommended for production environments.Many new features for Python 3.13 are still being planned and written. The most notable change so far:PEP 594 (Removing dead batteries from the standard library) scheduled removals of many deprecated modules: aifc, audioop, chunk, cgi, cgitb, crypt, imghdr, mailcap, msilib, nis, nntplib, ossaudiodev, pipes, sndhdr, spwd, sunau, telnetlib, uu, xdrlib, lib2to3.Many other removals of deprecated classes, functions and methods in various standard library modules.New deprecations, most of which are scheduled for removal from Python 3.15 or 3.16.C API removals and deprecations.

It is essentially a proportionality constant that relates the different observed magnetic moments μ of a particle to their angular momentum quantum numbers and a unit of magnetic moment (to make it dimensionless), usually the Bohr magneton or nuclear magneton. Its value is proportional to the gyromagnetic ratio.We hope you enjoy the new releases!Thanks to all of the many volunteers who help make Python Development and these releases possible!
