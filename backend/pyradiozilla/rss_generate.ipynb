This release is expected to become the final 3.13.0 release, barring any critical bugs being discovered. The official release of 3.13.0 is now scheduled for Monday, 2024-10-07.This extra, unplanned release candidate exists because of a couple of last minute issues, primarily a significant performance regression in specific workloads due to the incremental cyclic garbage collector (introduced in the alpha releases). We decided to roll back the garbage collector change in 3.13 (and continuing work in 3.14 to improve it), apply a number of other important bug fixes, and roll out a new release candidate.There will be no ABI changes from this point forward in the 3.13 series (and there haven't been any since the beta releases).Call to actionWe strongly encourage maintainers of Python projects to prepare their projects for 3.13 compatibilities during this phase, and where necessary publish Python 3.13 wheels on PyPI to be ready for the final release of 3.13.0.

However,\\n due to an incompatibility with older macOS versions, macOS 10.9 through\\n 10.12 will downgrade their version of pip to 24.1.2 during the \\ninstallation process (in the Install Certificates step). See the installer ReadMe and the pip issue on the matter\\n for more information. Versions of macOS older than 10.13 haven’t been \\nsupported by Apple since 2019, and maintaining support for them is \\nbecoming increasingly difficult. While this release of 3.12 still \\nsupports them, it is likely that we will be forced to drop support for macOS 10.12 and older in a future 3.12 release.

More exceptions potentially caused by typos now make suggestions to the user.Support for the Linux perf profiler to report Python function names in traces.Many large and small performance improvements (like PEP 709 and support for the BOLT binary optimizer), delivering an estimated 5% overall performance improvement.\\nType annotations\\nNew type annotation syntax for generic classes (PEP 695).New override decorator for methods (PEP 698).\\nDeprecations\\nThe deprecated wstr and wstr_length members of the C implementation of unicode objects were removed, per PEP 623.In the unittest module, a number of long deprecated methods and classes were removed. (They had been deprecated since Python 3.1 or 3.2).The deprecated smtpd and distutils modules have been removed (see PEP 594 and PEP 632. The setuptools package continues to provide the distutils module.A number of other old, broken and deprecated functions, classes and methods have been removed.Invalid backslash escape sequences in strings now warn with SyntaxWarning instead of DeprecationWarning, making them more visible. (They will become syntax errors in the future.)The internal representation of integers has changed in preparation \\nfor performance enhancements.

More exceptions potentially caused by typos now make suggestions to the user.Support for the Linux perf profiler to report Python function names in traces.Many large and small performance improvements (like PEP 709 and support for the BOLT binary optimizer), delivering an estimated 5% overall performance improvement.\\nType annotations\\nNew type annotation syntax for generic classes (PEP 695).New override decorator for methods (PEP 698).\\nDeprecations\\nThe deprecated wstr and wstr_length members of the C implementation of unicode objects were removed, per PEP 623.In the unittest module, a number of long deprecated methods and classes were removed. (They had been deprecated since Python 3.1 or 3.2).The deprecated smtpd and distutils modules have been removed (see PEP 594 and PEP 632. The setuptools package continues to provide the distutils module.A number of other old, broken and deprecated functions, classes and methods have been removed.Invalid backslash escape sequences in strings now warn with SyntaxWarning instead of DeprecationWarning, making them more visible. (They will become syntax errors in the future.)The internal representation of integers has changed in preparation \\nfor performance enhancements.

It is a concentration of heat, light or radiation so intense that its energy forms an event horizon and becomes self-trapped. In other words, if enough radiation is aimed into a region of space, the concentration of energy can warp spacetime so much that it creates a black hole. This would be a black hole whose original mass–energy was in the form of radiant energy rather than matter, however as soon as it forms, it is indistinguishable from an ordinary black hole.We hope you enjoy the new releases!Thanks to all of the many volunteers who help make Python Development and these releases possible!

Further, because it has five quarks instead of the usual three found in regular baryons (a.k.a. 'triquarks'), it is classified as an exotic baryon. The name pentaquark was coined by Claude Gignoux and Harry J. Lipkin in 1987; however, the possibility of five-quark particles was identified as early as 1964 when Murray Gell-Mann first postulated the existence of quarks. Although predicted for decades, pentaquarks proved surprisingly difficult to discover and some physicists were beginning to suspect that an unknown law of nature prevented their production.We hope you enjoy the new releases!Thanks to all of the many volunteers who help make Python Development and these releases possible!

It introduces several new features, including more flexible f-string parsing, support for the buffer protocol in Python code, a new debugging/profiling API, isolated subinterpreters, and improved error messages.  Type annotation enhancements include new syntax for generic classes and an override decorator for methods.\\n\\nThe update also highlights deprecations and removals in Python 3.12, such as the removal of deprecated modules (smtpd and distutils) and certain functions.\\n\\n\\nFinally, the announcement includes a thought-provoking poem titled \"Refugees\" by Brian Bilston, prompting reflection on societal attitudes towards those seeking refuge.', directory='/media/timur/TESLA SSD/2024-11-08T10.36.24.921128_run')]"

It is possible to construct malicious pickle data which will execute arbitrary code during unpickling (See https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/SECURITY.md#untrusted-models for more details). In a future release, the default value for `weights_only` will be flipped to `True`. This limits the functions that could be executed during unpickling. Arbitrary objects will no longer be allowed to be loaded via this mode unless they are explicitly allowlisted by the user via `torch.serialization.add_safe_globals`. We recommend you start setting `weights_only=True` for any use case where you don't have full control of the loaded file.
